#   PART I - SETUP
#
##############################################################################

Step 1. Make sure VirtualBox has been installed and your VMs can be started from VirtualBox Manager without any problem. Shutdown the VMs and close VirtualBox Manager.

IMPORTANT: If you want to control your VMs with VRDP, enable remote display at display settings and assign a dedicated port for each individual VM (e.g. use: 3010 for Vm0, 3020 for Vm1, etc.). Do NOT use the standard port 3389!


Step 2. Download and unzip the latest release of VBoxVmService to c:\vms.

Step 3. Open up VBoxVmService.ini with a texteditor of your choice and modify it to fit your needs. The file contains an example setup with two virtual machines.

Key / Value pair                                            Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Settings]
VBOX_USER_HOME=C:\Users\YOUR_NAME_HERE\.VirtualBox          The actual path to your user's .VirtualBox directory. It is usually located in your users' personal folder.
RunWebService=no                                            Whether or not start up VBoxWebSrv.exe, the VirtualBox HTTP web service automatically. Could be "yes" or "no". Leave it to "no" if you don't know what it is.
WebServiceParam=                                            If necessary, you can specify additional parameters for VBoxWebSrv.exe, like "--port" for binding to non-default port. 
PauseShutdown=5000                                          A pause parameter to slow down the Windows shutdown process and to prevent VMs from crashing on shutdown/reboot. (5000 = 5 seconds) Note Windows has a limit to how long the service controller could wait when system reboots. The time limit is specified in the WaitToKillServiceTimeout value of the following registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control. Your PauseShutdown value should never exceed this time limit.

[Vm0]
VmName=ubuntu                                               The name of the VM to start (case sensitive!)
ShutdownMethod=savestate                                    The shutdown method ("savestate", or "acpipowerbutton"). When "savestate" is used, the machine state is saved and will be resumed when you start VM next time. When "acpipowerbutton" is used, as long as client OS support it, the VM will get a clean shutdown. If your VM takes long time to poweroff, it's recommanded to use savestate, which could be done very quickly.
AutoStart=yes                                               Whether or not this VM will be started automatically, when VBoxVmService runs. Default to "yes".

[Vm1]
VmName=winxp                                                As you can see, the above values almost repeat for every [VmX] section of the file. 
ShutdownMethod=acpipowerbutton
AutoStart=no                                                This VM will not be started automatically.

#   PART II - INSTALLATION
#
##############################################################################

Step 1. (for WINXP / SERVER2003) Launch CMD (Command Prompt) from your start menu.

Step 1. (for VISTA / SERVER2008 / WIN7) Right-click on CMD (Command Prompt) and choose "Run as Administrator" from the context menu.

Step 2. Install the service. Within the terminal window type:
    
    cd C:\vms               [ENTER]
    
    VmServiceControl.exe -i    [ENTER]

Step 3. Reboot your system.

If everything goes on right, you could now connect to your VMs with VRDP clients (or ssh clients, if you've configured ssh server inside your VM). If not, refer to TROUBLESHOOTING section below for how to debug.

#   PART III - UNINSTALL
#
##############################################################################

Step 1. (for WINXP / SERVER2003) Launch CMD (Command Prompt) from your start menu.

Step 1. (for VISTA / SERVER2008 / WIN7) Right-click on CMD (Command Prompt) and choose "Run as Administrator" from the context menu.

Step 2. Stop the VBoxVmService service. Within the terminal window type:

    cd C:\vms               [ENTER]

    VmServiceControl.exe -k    [ENTER]

Note: you could also stop the service from Computer Management Console in Control Panel.

Step 3. Uninstall the service. Continue in the terminal window type:
    
    
    VmServiceControl.exe -u    [ENTER]
    
Step 4. Delete the installation directory (in this example "c:\vms").

Step 5. You are done uninstalling VBoxVmService from your system.

#   PART IV - KNOWN ISSUES
#
##############################################################################

1. VboxVmService calls VirtualBox by COM API interface. Due to compatiblity changes in VirtualBox SDK, each VBoxVmService is only compatible with VirtualBox versions that use the same API interface. More specifically,
   *) VboxVmService 3.0 will only work on VirtualBox 4.0.X and 4.1.X;
   *) VboxVmService 3.1 will only work on VirtualBox 4.2.0 and later.

2. When VMs are started by VBoxVmService, their running status are not shown on VirtualBox Manager, and vice versa. This is due to a limitation on Windows system that service processes runs at different session than user programs. They just can't see each other.

3. VBoxVmService, and all the VMs it started, are run as LOCAL SYSTEM user by default installation. This default setting should just work "out of box". If for some reason, you need to run it with other account, you can change the user it run as at Computer Management Console. 

If the user you use is not in Administrator group, you will need to make sure it has enough privilege to access DCOM Component. See discussion at http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3483358&group_id=219058&atid=1045322 for more information.

#   PART V - TROUBLESHOOTING
#
##############################################################################

If the service does not bring your VMs up as desired, try this:

Carefully re-check the settings you made in "VBoxVmService.ini". 

Switch to a command prompt, cd to the VBoxVmService directory and type:

    VmServiceControl.exe -l   [ENTER]

to list all the VMs you configured in "VBoxVmService.ini", and there current states.

If something is wrong, reduce the number of VMs in your ini file to one (= only have the section [Settings] and the section [Vm0] in your ini-file) in your ini-file, for debugging.

The command:

    VmServiceControl.exe -su 0   [ENTER]

can be used to bring up the VM you set up in the section [Vm0] of the "VBoxVmService.ini" file.

If you have successfully started a VM, you should end up with a "VBoxHeadless.exe" process, running as the impersonated user (check in task manager).

The command:

    VmServiceControl.exe -sd 0   [ENTER]

can be used to check the output, generated by the steps of a shutdown process targeting [Vm0]. Afterwards, there should be no running "VBoxHeadless.exe"-process. Additionally, you should see a "VBoxSVC.exe"-process terminating shortly after a successful shutdown of "VBoxHeadless.exe".

And the command:

    VmServiceControl.exe -st 0   [ENTER]

can be used to check the statue of the VM targeting [Vm0].

Read the log-file! 

If you see error like "Could not find a registered machine named...", check if the environment variable VBOX_USER_HOME has been setup correctly.

If you made a mistake on VBOX_USER_HOME, however, fixing it at VBoxVmService.ini is not enough. Because the value was get written into environment variable during installation. You need to open Control Panel -> System -> Advanced system settings -> Advanced -> Environment Variables, and fix it there. Please also make sure VBOX_USER_HOME appears only at system variables, not user variables.

After installation and everytime when you changed VBOX_USER_HOME later, a system reboot is required to get VBoxVmService work correctly. So give it a try if you haven't. 

If you are still in trouble, you are welcome to create a support ticket at https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=219058&atid=1045322. Please be sure to include your VBoxVmService.ini and VBoxVmService.log, so that we can try to figure out what the problem might be. We might be on VirtualBox's official forums now and then, so feel free to contact us there, too.
