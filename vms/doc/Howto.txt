#   PART I - SETUP
#
##############################################################################

Step 1. Download and unzip the latest release of VBoxVmService to c:\vms.

Step 2. Open up VBoxVmService.ini with a texteditor of your choice and modify it to fit your needs. The file contains an example setup with two virtual machines.

Key / Value pair                                            Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Settings]
ServiceName=VBoxVmService                                   The service name to use for the VBoxVmService.
VBOX_USER_HOME=C:\Users\YOUR_NAME_HERE\.VirtualBox          The actual path to your user's .VirtualBox directory. It is usually located in your users' personal folder.
PauseShutdown=5000                                          A pause parameter to slow down the Windows shutdown process and to prevent VMs from crashing on shutdown/reboot. (5000 = 5 seconds) Note Windows has a limit to how long the service controller could wait when system reboots. The time limit is specified in the WaitToKillServiceTimeout value of the following registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control. Your PauseShutdown value should never exceed this time limit.

[Vm0]
VmName=ubuntu                                               The name of the VM to start (case sensitive!)
WorkingDir=C:\vms                                           Usually the directory to which you unpacked VBoxVmService.
ShutdownMethod=savestate                                    The shutdown method ("savestate", or "acpipowerbutton"). When "savestate" is used, the machine state is saved and will be resumed when you start VM next time. When "acpipowerbutton" is used, as long as client OS support it, the VM will get a clean shutdown. If your VM takes long time to poweroff, it's recommanded to use savestate, which could be done very quickly.
VrdpPort=3001                                               The port setting for your VRDP-Access, choose 1 unique port per VM that you set up.

[Vm1]
VmName=winxp                                                As you can see, the above values almost repeat for every [VmX] section of the file. 
WorkingDir=C:\vms
ShutdownMethod=acpipowerbutton
VrdpPort=3002

#   PART II - INSTALLATION
#
##############################################################################

Step 1. (for WINXP / SERVER2003) Launch CMD (Command Prompt) from your start menu.

Step 1. (for VISTA / SERVER2008 / WIN7) Right-click on CMD (Command Prompt) and choose "Run as Administrator" from the context menu.

Step 2. Install the service. Within the terminal window type:
    
    cd C:\vms               [ENTER]
    
    VmServiceControl.exe -i    [ENTER]

Step 3. Startup the service. Continue in the terminal window type:

    VmServiceControl.exe -s    [ENTER]

Note: you could also start the service from Computer Management Console in Control Panel. The service will also be startup automatically when your system reboots.

Step 4: You are done installing. If everything goes on right, you could now connect to your VMs with VRDP clients (or ssh clients, if you've configured ssh server inside your VM).

#   PART III - UNINSTALL
#
##############################################################################

Step 1. (for WINXP / SERVER2003) Launch CMD (Command Prompt) from your start menu.

Step 1. (for VISTA / SERVER2008 / WIN7) Right-click on CMD (Command Prompt) and choose "Run as Administrator" from the context menu.

Step 2. Stop the VBoxVmService service. Within the terminal window type:

    cd C:\vms               [ENTER]

    VmServiceControl.exe -k    [ENTER]

Note: you could also stop the service from Computer Management Console in Control Panel.

Step 3. Uninstall the service. Continue in the terminal window type:
    
    
    VmServiceControl.exe -u    [ENTER]
    
Step 4. Delete the installation directory (in this example "c:\vms").

Step 5. You are done uninstalling VBoxVmService from your system.

#   PART IV - TROUBLESHOOTING
#
##############################################################################

If the service does not bring your VMs up as desired, try this:

Carefully re-check the settings you made in "VBoxVmService.ini". 

Reduce the number of VMs in your ini file to one (= only have the section [Settings] and the section [Vm0] in your ini-file) in your ini-file, for debugging.

Switch to a command prompt, cd to the VBoxVmService directory and type:

    VmServiceControl.exe -su 0   [ENTER]

to bring up the VM you set up in the section [Vm0] of the "VBoxVmService.ini" file.

If you have successfully started a VM, you should end up with a "VBoxHeadless.exe" process, running as the impersonated user (check in task manager).

The command:

    VmServiceControl.exe -sd 0   [ENTER]

can be used to check the output, generated by the steps of a shutdown process targeting [Vm0]. Afterwards, there should be no running "VBoxHeadless.exe"-process. Additionally, you should see a "VBoxSVC.exe"-process terminating shortly after a successful shutdown of "VBoxHeadless.exe".

IMPORTANT: If you want to control your VMs with VRDP, assign a dedicated port for each individual VM. Do NOT use the standard port 3389 (e.g. use: 3010 for Vm0, 3020 for Vm1, etc.)!

Read the log-file! 

If you see error like "ERROR: Could not find a registered machine named...", if VBOX_USER_HOME has been setup correctly, then it means VBoxVmService service, running as SYSTEM user by default, can't access the folder pointed to by
VBOX_USER_HOME. Check the permission on this folder and change if necessary. 

If you made a mistake on VBOX_USER_HOME, however, fixing it at VBoxVmService.ini is not enough. Because the value was get written into environment variable during installation. You need to open Control Panel -> System -> Advanced system settings -> Advanced -> Environment Variables, and fix it there. Please also make sure VBOX_USER_HOME appears only at system variables, not user variables.

Some reported that a system reboot is required after installation to get VBoxVmService work correctly. So give it a try if you haven't. 

The VBoxVmService Dev Team might be on VirtualBox's official forums now and then, so feel free to contact us there.
