
Licence
----------------------------------------------------------------

All the tools, all the sourcecode and just everything I used was 

"free to use by anybody", so VBoxVmService is too, of course.

Since I do not take any responsability for any eventual damage 

using this software might possibly do to your system(s) and since 

I am not a legal guy, let's just call it a "free as in 'free beer' 

licence": If you like it, you are welcome to use it. And if you 

don't, just don't sue me. :-)
